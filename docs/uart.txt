UART - An AVR USART implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stdio interface to the ATmega hardware UART. The implementation is interrupt
-driven and uses ringbuffers for each direction and allows for full duplex
communication.

Usage:
#include <stdio.h>

...
FILE uart;
uart_init(UART_BAUD(2400, F_CPU), &uart, NULL);

You may also (optionally) register an overrun handler which will be called
whenever an receiver overrun occurs. This can be used as a warning for the
consumer that,
1) producer is too fast (throttle)
2) data consumption is too slow
3) data is being lost

uart_init(UART_BAD(2400, F_CPU), &uart, orun_handler);

...

- Use fputc(), fprintf() etc to write.
- Use fgetc(), fread() etc to read.

You may also assign the UART stream to become your stdin/stdout:
stdin = &uart;
stdout = &uart;

After this all standard functions will use the UART for I/O, such as:
printf, scanf etc.
